### A few instructions for the files uploaded:

1. The notebook was implemented using Google Colab so cell numbering is an issue
2. You will have to add all the dependencies to make detectron2 run since it uses PyTorch
3. I have also added a 2 liner code to clone the dataset i have used. If you don't want to use that, i have added the data files in the data folder
4. The output folder has the weights i have trained while making the model
